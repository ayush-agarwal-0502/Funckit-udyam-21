Solutions for funckit udyam 21 , digital electronics competition by IIT BHU 

Hi, I'm Ayush Agarwal, Electronics engineering student at IIT BHU Varanasi . Participated in UDYAM'21 Digital Electronics event Funckit . Participated in a team of 3 , with Suhani Agrawal and Ayushi Gupta . Here are the PS1 and PS2 and whatever solution I could find on my computer ( compiling this in 2nd year , don't remember what the PS was ) 

The problem statment can be seen from the official site of udyam :

Or in case the site takes it down (which it shouldn't) , here's a local copy on the repository :
